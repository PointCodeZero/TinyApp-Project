## Problem Statement

Users will be able to shorten long URLs much like TinyURL.com and bit.ly do.

## Expected Usage

This program should be executed from the browser, in the following manner:

1- Add URL to be shorten and submit through a form
2- Get your brand new shortened URL and add to your address bar
3- The new shorten URL will redirect you to the webpage of the original URL
